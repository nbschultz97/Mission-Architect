# Mission Architect

Static single-page app for Ceradon Mission Architect, served via GitHub Pages with the custom domain `mission.ceradonsystems.com`.

## Hosting notes
- Pages expects `index.html` at the repository root; all site assets now live at the root to align with GitHub Pages.
- Custom domain is set via the `CNAME` file.
